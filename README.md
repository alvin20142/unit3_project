As you know the telecom market is very competitive. Everyone wants to get the most out of their money. Low costs with same services for everyone, provided by many companies. All the customers need is just a phone and you can switch the SIM cards.

The idea here is we are trying to identify these people who churned from the company. Who they are and why? 

In the code, different clustering methods have been used to determine which has the best result. Kmeans, DBScan and Hierarchical clusterings have been used.

The requirements text are libraries version that was used at the time of making this project.
